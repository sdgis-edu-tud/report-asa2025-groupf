## Problem Statement, Objectives and Criteria

Here we talk about our understanding of the problem (both in a general sense and more specifically in our research goals), and the questions for each objective that brought us to choose the criteria.

### Theoretical framework: The idea of Ecological Restoration

Our group’s understanding of ecological restoration is reflected well in the evolution of debates and the resulting definition of the discipline, developed by the newly formed Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) in the 1980s and first published in 1990\.

> Ecological Restoration is the process of intentionally altering a site to establish a defined, indigenous, historic ecosystem. The goal of this process is to emulate the structure, function, diversity and dynamics of the specified ecosystem.
> (Higgs, 1994)

***What to leave behind*** —The emerging movement sought to move beyond human-centric notions that had shaped the goals and perspectives of restoration efforts. It aimed to reposition humans as part of complex ecosystems rather than the central focus of resource management. Terms like ‘conservation’ and ‘preservation’ were avoided, as they implied managing “natural resources” for human use or protecting wilderness for its scenic value. At the heart of earlier approaches was the objectification of nature as a resource to be used, enjoyed, and controlled: projects often sought to simplify streams and floodplains, eliminating ecological dynamics seen as barriers to flood control and land development. By the late 1990s, it was increasingly recognized that flood damage reduction and ecosystem protection could be achieved through the same project. This marked a shift in thinking among floodplain managers—**from single-purpose flood control to integrated river and floodplain interventions that mitigate flood impacts while providing ecological benefits.**

Even the aforementioned definition of restoration sparked debates about how to define “indigenous” or “historic” ecosystems, given that ecological systems constantly evolve. This raises the question: which point in history should we aim to restore to? After all, there is a difference between restoring for maximum biodiversity and supporting the local dynamics of a functioning ecosystem. Especially in urban contexts, practitioners recognized that land use disturbances made it unrealistic to recreate indigenous or historic environments as they once were. This is why the new approaches to restorations were influenced by the imperative, already emerged in the 1930s, of repairing or reversing damage caused by human activity on ecosystems. 

***What makes an ecosystem and its restoration*** — What persists of these definitions are the core variables that should inform any restoration. First, the **structure of forms** composing an ecosystem — the spatial pattern or arrangement of landscape elements (patches, corridors, and matrices) which strongly controls movements, flows, and changes [@dramstad1996landscape]. Second, the ‘ecosystem functions’, later redefined as ‘ecological **processes**’, intended as the “dynamic attributes of ecosystems, including interactions among organisms and interactions between organisms and their environments” or more simply put by @dramstad1996landscape, the **movements and flows** of animals, plants, water, wind, materials, and energy through the structure. Lastly, a restoration project should aim to provide **resiliency**, the ability of the ecosystem to sustain itself without regular maintenance or interventions: the native plants and animal species should thrive, sustain reproducing populations necessary for their stability, and be capable of enduring periodic environmental stress events (such as a fire or flood) that serve to maintain the integrity of the ecosystem.

Finally, a suggestive and far-reaching paradigm was provided by one of the founders of the movement, William Jordan, who argued that **individuals and communities must be active participants in ecological recovery, and that healing natural systems would also foster the recovery of human communities.** The benefits would go beyond an economic view of the use and enjoyment of our collective natural resources, encompassing the **re-creation of a “sense of community” and a “sense of place.”** Restoration should aim to create functioning **environments where diverse species can thrive while also restoring social and historical identity** in a generation increasingly disconnected from place by freeways, strip malls, and car-centric development.

### Problem Statement and Research Question

Along with the Elbe river, Dresden comprises a dense network of streams, which are spread out across its fabric. Presently, the streams are secluded from being a valuable part of the city. The problems are characterised by ecological issues, inappropriate land use by residents, and artificial channelling (Project case description). They, along with the Elbe river hold potential to become elements of integrating the ecological and social functions of the city by reclaiming the historical identity of waterfronts and restoring natural habitats. Therefore, there arises a need to understand how to integrate these streams into the network of protected green areas and public spaces, while maximising their contribution to biodiversity while adapting to the risk of flooding within and around the city.

These concerns and identified potentials beg the question that, **how can urban streams be restored and integrated in Dresden's fabric, such that there is a synergy between human activities and the natural environment?**

To articulate the challenges and identify the potentials to answer the question, the analysis is divided into three sub-research categories under the broad themes of biodiversity, climate adaptation and quality of life. Each theme has specific criteria with  its attributes, which are analysed, measured and weighted against each other to arrive at the final decisions.  

### Biodiversity: What are the potentials and current urgencies in the integration of the natural elements in the urban landscape of Dresden?

The criteria of **connectivity** and **quality** are chosen to improve the existing habitats and further expand them.

1. Connectivity — The attributes defined within connectivity aims to identify the potential of improving the connections between the existing vegetation areas. The potential green corridors along the streams are highlighted by using the 'greenspace' layer from OpenStreetMaps. The layer consists of the various typologies of green infrastructure of Dresden's fabric. These are a combination of planned and recreational spaces (parks and traffic-side greenery) and natural spaces (forests, meadows, grass). To identify the potential near the streams, the following sub-criteria is defined for measurement:
 
   1a. Green-Blue connectivity: Blue-green infrastructure (BGI), combining semi-natural and engineered elements, offers multifaceted benefits like stormwater management, water purification, heat mitigation, and habitat provision (Perrelet et al 2024). To analyse the gaps in vegetation along the stream corridors, the greenspace layer from OpenStreetMap is modified to see the fragments between vegetation which lie within a 250 meter buffer from the streams.

2. Quality —  The attributes defined under quality aim to assess the quality of the ecological environment near the streams. This is done by analysing the soil quality using the Bodenqualität (soil quality) layer from the Dresden open data portal and by analysing the plant health using the Sentinel-2 data from Google Earth Engine.   
   2a. Soil quality: Soil quality indicates the capacity of the soil to support ecological functions. Within the objective of integrating natural elements in the landscape of Dresden, it becomes crucial to understand where the areas with poor soil quality lie so that they can be restrored for vegetation.   
   2b. Plant health: Plant health reveals the existing plantation which is in poor quality, and is hence also impacting the health of the overall ecosystem. 


### Climate Adaptation: What are the main challenges and the potential spatial interventions to adapt to climate change?

To address this question, we focused on identifying both the areas most vulnerable to climate-related hazards and those with potential for ecological intervention.

*Flood exposure* \- For flood adaptation, our first step was to understand the severity and spatial extent of flood risk across the city. We wanted to identify which areas are most at risk under different flood scenarios (e.g. HQ20, HQ100, and extreme events), and how these risks are spatially distributed in relation to existing infrastructure and urban development. This required the use of high-resolution flood hazard maps and the creation of an 'exposure to floods' attribute, which allowed us to quantify and compare the vulnerability of different areas.

*Soil infiltration* \- For soil infiltration, our interest shifted toward understanding the capacity of different soils—especially those in proximity to water bodies—to absorb and regulate rainwater. These areas can potentially act as buffers that mitigate surface runoff and reduce flood pressure. We therefore used the Soil Infiltration Capacity layer to assess which spatial units could support light ecological restoration and which would require more significant interventions, such as the removal of built surfaces or the reintroduction of native vegetation. Together, these two strands of analysis aimed to reveal where and how spatial interventions could be most effectively targeted to support climate adaptation.

### Quality of Life: How accessible, inviting, and diverse is Dresden's public space, and how can it reach its full potential?

Urban stream restoration is increasingly used as a strategy for improving the physical and ecological conditions of degraded urban streams. Beyond ecological benefit, it also has a social impact for enhancing the quality of life for the residents living in urban areas.

Urban stream restoration, especially combined with green spaces, can provide amenities, recreational opportunities, and environmental health benefits that contribute directly to residents’ well-being. Therefore, it is important to foster awareness and supportive attitudes toward stream restoration projects, while also addressing the issue of just distribution and equal access to streams.

Three important aspects of restoration projects relate to this benefit, they are attractiveness, accessibility, and diversity. Attractiveness is related to how inviting the streams are for residents, which can be assessed by analysing the use of the entire landscape, from riparian zones to uplands, to maximize ecological and societal benefits, and by evaluating how visible the streams are from urban areas. Accessibility ensures that people of all ages and backgrounds can physically reach the stream for walking and socializing. Meanwhile, diversity refers to the surrounding land uses that support multifunctionality. When streams are embedded within a landscape with various uses, they become shared community assets rather than isolated environmental features.

1. Attractiveness — Aims to assess how inviting Dresden’s stream corridors are as public spaces. It involves evaluating the following sub-criteria:  
   1. Spatial openness (encasement)  
   2. Visibility of the streams from surrounding urban areas
2. Accessibility — Aims to analyse how accessible Dresden’s streams are to the public, especially within walking distance, using two sub-criteria:  
   1. Distance of stream corridors and green spaces  
   2. Proximity
3. Diversity — Aims to evaluate the diversity of land uses around the streams to support multifunctionality.

### Spatial Units and other notes

The spatial units used in this study are hexagons with a dimension of 300 meters. The study area of Dresden is divided using a complete surface of a hexagonal pattern. Then it is overlaid with the water stream network and river body from OpenStreetMap to keep only the hexagons that intersect with at least one stream. Finally, the isolated hexagons were removed.

![Spatial Units of waterbodies & streams across Dresden](../images/Spatial_Units.png)

The main reason behind picking the dimensions of 300 meters is based on two main reasons:

1. The walking/biking distance: the estimated radius is used to evaluate the spaces around the water stream within a low walking distance, as pedestrians or cyclists have the highest exposure and engagement with urban streams.  
2. The space but not the line: the spatial units are also going to determine the probable area of intervention. Then the streams are not the only lines that need to be changed, but the space surrounding them is also affected in both ways. This space includes the buildings, facilities, and natural habitats that all have synergies along with their neighboring stream structure.

![The Dimensions of spatial units and the river buffer radius](../images/Spatial_Units_Zoomed_In.jpeg)

The spatial units are also filtered by a 500-meter buffer of the main river, Elde, as it is one of the key spatial elements that have shaped the city’s form, functions, mobilities, and identity that cannot be overlooked. So, a larger buffer of hexagonal spatial units where divided in the buffer zone of the Elde river as it covers a larger area of the urban fabric in terms of biodiversity, morphology, climate adaptation, and quality of life.

## Attributes and Layers

Based on the criteria that we decided to tackle, we had to come up with numerical indicators that we could use to evaluate them. These numerical indicators are called attributes and have to be normalised—in our case between 0 and 1—so that they can be compared and weighted properly depending on their relevance. In our case, 0 corresponds to an urgent need to perform urban stream restoration, while 1 corresponds to a situation that is currently very good, or at least the best in the area of interest.

In practice, these attributes also needed to be aggregable at the scale of the spatial units, so that we can assign one unique value to each spatial unit for each attribute. This can be an important limitation on the type of computations and therefore the type of attributes that we can use. We explain below the different attributes that we computed, how we computed them, which data we used and why we made these choices.

*(Attributes with an asterisk \* are mentioned the ‘Discussion’ chapter at the end of the report)*

### Biodiversity

#### Connectivity

##### *Green-blue connectivity\**

The aim to measure the blue-green connectivity was to identify the potential areas which can become green corridors along the lengths of the stream. To do that, the area of the vegetation layer from OpenStreetMap was quantified. The layer includes different types of green infrastructure found throughout Dresden, encompassing both designed recreational areas—such as parks and greenery along roads—and natural environments like forests, meadows, and grasslands.

![Mapping vegetation, urbanised areas, and undeveloped areas](../images/Green_connectivity_preliminary.png)

This layer was then intersected with the spatial units to focus on the vegetation which is within a 250m radius from the streams and falls within the defined spatial units. The values of the areas were then graduated to visualise the spatial units which lacked vegetation to those which were densely vegetated. These values were then normalised from 0 to 1 to make them comparable to other attributes. Here, 0 indicates the spaces which lack vegetation and 1 indicates dense vegetation, signalling at the potential spaces to add vegetation and form green corridors along the streams.

![Identifying potential to establish green connectivity along the streams](../images/Green_connectivity.png)

#### Quality

##### *Soil quality*

The attribute is used to identify where the existing vegetation which has poor soil quality, as it signally at a degrading ecological habitat. Soil quality is measured as it is an integral measure of the ecological value of the soil. The layer used to compute the attribute were the vegetation layer from OpenStreetMap and the soil quality layer from Dresden OpenData. 

![Mapping the soil quality of vegetation in Dresden](../images/Vegetation_soil_quality_preliminary.png)

The two layers were intersected to see where the vegetation has poor soil quality. The resulting layer was intersected with the spatial units to focus on the vegetation near the streams. This helped us visualise the streams where the soil quality needed to be restored in order to restore natural habitats.

![Identifying vegetation with good soil quality and poor soil quality along the streams](../images/Vegetation_soil_quality.png)

##### *Plant health*

Plant health is measured using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), computed as an average of the values in June, July and August (when the vegetation is facing the highest stress) over the five last available years (2020-2024). The values are computed on a 10 by 10 m raster (based on the values of Sentinel-2), and then averaged over the spatial units. Higher values correspond to healthier vegetation.

### Climate Adaptation

#### Resilience to flood risks

##### *Available space near streams*

The necessity of available open space along the streams and the water body will be a potential opportunity for design interventions to prevent, or at least reduce, the flood risk along the streams’ banks. This can be achieved by calculating the available open space areas in the close proximity of the streams and rivers of Dresden.

![Open grasslands and undeveloped lands as available spaces along the streams](../images/Available_Spaces_1.png)

This was assessed by using the land use ground layer collected from the \[surfdrive\] dataset and filtered based on the undeveloped land and grassland values. After that, the layer was intersected with the spatial units to calculate the coverage space of each land type within each spatial unit before being joined by attributes to the raw spatial units again.

![Available spaces along the streams by area](../images/Available_Spaces_2.png)

By joining the intersected layer to spatial units based on their join attributes, the available space within each spatial unit is already available. In order to normalize the values, the area values were all divided by the highest area number, and the new results were distributed between zero, as the lowest coverage or available area, and one, as the highest coverage and available area.

![Normalized values of space availability along the streams](../images/Available_Spaces_3.png)

##### *Exposure to floods*

As part of a study commissioned by the Civil Engineering Office in 2020, following the introduction of a new flood protection law in the Saxony region, a new rainfall-runoff model was developed. Based on this model, working maps were created to show the areas that would be flooded during events expected to statistically occur once every 20 and 100 years, as well as under an additional extreme scenario.

Using the spatial layers from these scenarios, which indicated the areas affected by each flood event, we created an attribute for “exposure to floods.” Exposure to one or more flood risk areas was assigned a negative weight, with the severity increasing for each additional scenario to which an area was exposed.

The aggregation of this data into a single attribute was carried out by first creating separate polygons for areas where multiple flood scenarios overlapped. Then, a value between 0 and 1 was assigned to each layer, using percentage-based weighting to reflect the relative severity of each scenario. We were interested in answering the following question: which are the most flood-prone areas in Dresden?

##### *Soil infiltration capacity*

Soil sealing caused by infrastructure prevents water from being absorbed into the ground, accelerates surface runoff, and reduces space for natural stream dynamics. Identifying areas most affected by man-made interventions was therefore a key priority. However, even in unsealed areas, not all soils absorb water equally. In the context of an analysis aimed at informing integrated, city-wide interventions, it is essential to consider the varying water absorption capacities of different soil types.

To address this, we used the Soil Infiltration Capacity layer to assign each spatial unit a degree of infiltration potential. This allowed us to distinguish between areas where water can be absorbed with minimal, ‘light’ ecological restoration and those that require more intensive interventions—such as the removal of built structures or the restoration of ecological processes specific to the local soil type and its characteristics.

#### Resilience to heat waves

##### *Sealing*

Not handled yet.

##### *Surfaces reflection index*

Not sure if we will use it.

##### *Shade*

By knowing the shade coverage of open spaces across the stream area networks, the potential areas for heat resilience can be spotted. Also, the open spaces that have the highest exposure to the heat waves can be recognised through the ground shadow analysis, especially during the peak time of warm periods in the area.  

The DSM and DTM raster layers were needed to run the shadow analysis based on the building and vegetation heights. The raster layer was clipped out based on the dissolved layer of spatial units to limit the area of analysis. The buildings layer was also masked out from the DSM layer and patched with it again to represent the updated building heights. After that, the aspect and edge heights were calculated using the UMEP plugin to process the preliminary data for the shadow analysis. The shadow analysis is done based on three time intervals during the day within the peak times of warm periods in the area.

![Shadow analysis done by the UMEP processing tool](../images/ShadowAnalysis_1.png)

The output layer with which was a raster layer, was then aggregated to the spatial units using the Zonal Statistics tool to translate the shading values to the polygon spatial units. The output values were the median (average) values contained within each spatial unit and were already distributed between zero (full shadow) and one (no shadow) values.

![Normalizing the shadow analysis values between zero & one](../images/ShadowAnalysis_2.png)  

### Quality of Life

#### Attractiveness

##### *Visibility*

The visibility factor refers to how visible the streams are from an urban area. The analysis is conducted by interpolating points from the streamline with a 500-meter radius of urban surroundings. This is also a qualitative value that reflects the visual openness of the streams through a quantitative method.

![](../images/Analysis_Visibility.png)

#### Accessibility

The idea behind the accessibility is that for the quality of life, spatial units that are closer to places where inhabitants live are more valuable and more important than those that are harder to reach. Therefore, we wanted to study how many people leave close to each spatial unit, and are therefore accessible by feet. To do so, we settled on a threshold of 1km for the maximum distance that makes a spatial unit accessible, and we used the following steps to compute the accessibility:

1. Extract the center point of each spatial unit. These will serve as destination points for the spatial units.
2. Sample points on a 200m×200m grid and only keep those in a 1km buffer around the spatial units. These will serve as start points representing where people live. Assign to each of these points a population density based on the density grid 1000m×1000m of Germany in the year 2020.
3. Compute the paths between all pairs of start and destination points. We used the roads from OpenStreetMap. Using this layer required to clean up some isolated roads, because some starting points or spatial units centered would be attached to parts of the network that were not connected to the rest, and therefore it was not possible to find paths. To identify them, we run the path computation from all points to one point, and then manually removed parts of the network that were isolated and preventing the algorithm from finding paths.
4. Keep only the paths that are shorter than 1km, representing convenient accessibility by feet.
5. Compute the accessibility of each spatial unit $\text{su}$ as:
   $$\text{accessibility}(su) = \sum\limits_{sp \;\in\; \text{Starting points}} \text{population}(sp) \times (2000 - \text{distance}(su,sp))$$
   The reason for using 2000m as a basis is so that a 0m distance has two times more value than a 1000m distance (the maximum we kept).

The final value is not really interpretable, as it is a population density multiplied by a distance, but it gives us a good indication of spatial units that are the most accessible.

#### Diversity

##### *Land use variety*

This analysis identifies the types of land use around the stream corridors, more variety of uses enhances the connectivity of streams with the current urban fabric. It is well connected if there are various public spaces and/ or amenities present.

## Weighting of the Attributes

Once each attribute has produced a normalised value for each spatial unit, all the attributes need to be aggregated into one final value. Since all of them do not participate equally to the goals we mentioned earlier, we tried to weight them according to their relative importance in achieving our goals. These weights could then be used to compute a weighted average that is easier to use thanks to reducing the problem to one dimension instead of several dimensions.

To compute the weights, we made individual Saaty matrices for the attributes of each of the three objectives. Saaty matrices are square matrices that allow us to deduce weights from pairwise comparisons of the attributes [@Saaty1987analytic]. In our case, we used the eigenvector method to calculate the weights. The matrices and weights are shown in @tbl-saaty-matrices below.

Then, we divided them by 3 to assign the same weight to the three attributes, and got a final set of weights that summed to 1. We chose this method because it allowed us to assign more weights to the most reliable and pertinent attributes, while maintaining the balance between the three main objectives.

saaty_tables <- lapply(
  seq_along(saaty_matrices),
  function(i) {
    matrix_to_table(saaty_matrices[[i]], attributes[[i]])
  }
)

show_table(
  matrix_to_table(saaty_matrices[["Biodiversity"]], attributes[["Biodiversity"]]),
  saaty_weights[["Biodiversity"]][["weights"]]
)
show_table(
  matrix_to_table(saaty_matrices[["Climate Adaptation"]], attributes[["Climate Adaptation"]]),
  saaty_weights[["Climate Adaptation"]][["weights"]]
)
show_table(
  matrix_to_table(saaty_matrices[["Quality of Life"]], attributes[["Quality of Life"]]),
  saaty_weights[["Quality of Life"]][["weights"]]
)
```

These weights were computed with respective consistency ratios of `{r} saaty_weights[["Biodiversity"]][["consistency_ratio"]]`, `{r} saaty_weights[["Climate Adaptation"]][["consistency_ratio"]]`, and `{r} saaty_weights[["Quality of Life"]][["consistency_ratio"]]` for Biodiversity, Climate Adaptation, and Quality of Life.
These values are below the threshold of 0.1 prescribed by @Saaty1987analytic, which indicates that the pairwise comparisons were consistent enough to be used in the analysis.
