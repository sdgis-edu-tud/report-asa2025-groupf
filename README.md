# Report template for the Applied Spatial Analytics 2025 course

This is a template repository used as a starting point for the group
reports produced in the Applied Spatial Analytics 2025 course at
TU Delft.

By starting this assignment in GitHub Classroom, you created a copy
of this repository that you have write access to. You will continue to
work on your report in that repository throughout the quarter. A great
way to practice and apply what you learned in the "Intro to Git and GitHub"
assignment!

### Getting started with the report

1. In RStudio, create a new project from version control. Use the
   URL of your repository to clone it.
   
2. To start working on the report, open the `report.qmd` file, add the
   names of your group members, and press on the "Render" button. Next,
   stage and commit all changed files and push them to GitHub. You will
   follow this **stage -> commit -> push** workflow every time you make a
   change.

### Feedback

In the **Pull requests** section of your repository, you will find a
**Feedback** pull request. We will use this pull request to provide
feedback on your report throughout the quarter. You can also use this
pull request to ask questions about the feedback.

### Asking for help

If you have questions about the assignment, please ask them in
[Discussions](https://github.com/sdgis-edu-tud/asa2025/discussions).
