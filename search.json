    "text": "1.1 Historical background\nIn this chapter, we will introduce our research, possibly including a summary of our first brainstorming, and, more importantly, present the first descriptive maps and explain how they give us clues on how to approach the analytical core of this spatial analysis project\nDresden originated as a small settlement on the left bank of the Elbe and remained modest until the 16th century, when it became the capital of the Protestant Electorate of Saxony after the Schmalkaldic War. Under Elector Moritz, the city expanded rapidly with major architectural and urban developments. In the 18th century, it became a key cultural and political center as the royal residence of the Polish kings, marked by the construction of prominent monuments like the Zwinger and the Frauenkirche. Throughout the 19th century, Dresden continued to grow, becoming the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony and undergoing a major population boom.\nThe 20th century brought devastation with the Allied bombing in 1945, which destroyed much of the city, including the Frauenkirche. Following reunification, major reconstruction efforts began in the 2000s, including the faithful rebuilding of Neumarkt square and other historical landmarks, with a mix of traditional and modern residential architecture.\nA key feature that emerged from historical photographs is the extensive use of the riverfront—large green meadows cutting through the urban fabric, which were historically used for social, economic, and cultural activities. These strips of grass, still visible today, offer clues to a spatial element that defines Dresden’s atmosphere: a city shaped not only by its architecture and history but also by its open, green relationship with the Elbe River.\nDresden has also faced major ecological challenges, notably the catastrophic Elbe floods of 1845 and 2002—the latter setting a new record and causing severe damage, much of which has since been repaired. These flood events highlight the importance of integrating ecosystem restoration and climate resilience into the city’s spatial planning.",

    "text": "1.2 Natural elements\nDresden is considered one of the greenest cities in Europe, with approximately 62% of its total area covered by forests, parks, and green spaces. This extensive green infrastructure includes the large woodland of the Dresdner Heide in the north and the Großer Garten in the city center, contributing to both ecological richness and urban quality of life. The city’s location in the Elbe Valley, framed by vineyards and wooded hills, is defined by the Elbe River, which meanders through the urban fabric and is bordered by wide river meadows. These meadows, cutting across the city, have historically hosted a variety of uses and activities—visible in old photographs—and remain a defining feature of Dresden’s atmosphere and spatial identity.\nThe Environment Office, responsible for nature conservation, places great emphasis on the protection of biotopes within the city. These areas not only serve as essential refuges for rare and endangered species, such as the beaver and corn crake, but also function as peaceful recreational spaces for residents. The presence of such species within the urban core is seen as a significant achievement in local conservation efforts and a testament to the ecological quality of Dresden’s landscape.\nTo further support the integration of nature into the city, Dresden’s current landscape plan is guided by the concept “Dresden—the compact city in the ecological network” (“Dresden – die kompakte Stadt im ökologischen Netz”). This approach emphasizes the need to balance urban density with ecological connectivity. The plan divides the city into sub-areas and introduces an ecological network structured through both net elements (functional spaces, high-value areas, ecological corridors, and green axes) and cell elements (ranging from compact urban cells to flexible and rural ones). Rather than defining fixed protected zones, this framework serves as a planning tool that guides future land use and development while respecting the city’s natural systems and polycentric structure.\nThe plan proposes 27 specific measures to guide future urban and landscape planning, aiming to protect, enhance, or restore ecological functions in different parts of the city. These measures provide orientation for decision-making across various departments and help ensure that Dresden continues to evolve as a resilient, biodiverse, and livable green city.",

    "text": "1.3 Built Environment\nDresden’s built environment reflects a complex layering of historical reconstruction, post-war development, and more recent car-centric urban expansion. The city is most recognizably shaped by its flood control strategies, which have left a prominent mark in the form of the wide, grassy Elbe meadows that traverse the urban core. While these meadows serve as a natural buffer for high waters, they remain largely undeveloped green corridors with limited ecological or recreational diversity. Beyond these, Dresden’s green spaces are relatively limited, with only a few notable urban parks and one major urban forest. Much of the city’s later development—particularly in the post-war and post-reunification periods—has prioritized road infrastructure and low-density layouts, contributing to a fragmented urban fabric that often lacks pedestrian accessibility and integrated ecological planning. This context underscores the need for rethinking the relationship between the built environment and the landscape to better support both human and non-human life.\n\n\n\n\nBernhardt, E., and M.

    "text": "2.1.1 Theoretical framework: The idea of Ecological Restoration\nOur group’s understanding of ecological restoration is reflected well in the evolution of debates and the resulting definition of the discipline, developed by the newly formed Society for Ecological Restoration (SER) in the 1980s and first published in 1990.\n\nEcological Restoration is the process of intentionally altering a site to establish a defined, indigenous, historic ecosystem. The goal of this process is to emulate the structure, function, diversity and dynamics of the specified ecosystem. (Higgs, 1994)\n\nWhat to leave behind —The emerging movement sought to move beyond human-centric notions that had shaped the goals and perspectives of restoration efforts. It aimed to reposition humans as part of complex ecosystems rather than the central focus of resource management. Terms like ‘conservation’ and ‘preservation’ were avoided, as they implied managing “natural resources” for human use or protecting wilderness for its scenic value. At the heart of earlier approaches was the objectification of nature as a resource to be used, enjoyed, and controlled: projects often sought to simplify streams and floodplains, eliminating ecological dynamics seen as barriers to flood control and land development. By the late 1990s, it was increasingly recognized that flood damage reduction and ecosystem protection could be achieved through the same project. This marked a shift in thinking among floodplain managers—from single-purpose flood control to integrated river and floodplain interventions that mitigate flood impacts while providing ecological benefits.\n\n\n\nLisa Kreishok (A. Riley 2016)\n\n\nEven the aforementioned definition of restoration sparked debates about how to define “indigenous” or “historic” ecosystems, given that ecological systems constantly evolve. This raises the question: which point in history should we aim to restore to? After all, there is a difference between restoring for maximum biodiversity and supporting the local dynamics of a functioning ecosystem. Especially in urban contexts, practitioners recognized that land use disturbances made it unrealistic to recreate indigenous or historic environments as they once were. This is why the new approaches to restorations were influenced by the imperative, already emerged in the 1930s, of repairing or reversing damage caused by human activity on ecosystems.\nWhat makes an ecosystem and its restoration — What persists of these definitions are the core variables that should inform any restoration. First, the structure of forms composing an ecosystem — the spatial pattern or arrangement of landscape elements (patches, corridors, and matrices) which strongly controls movements, flows, and changes (Dramstad, Olson, and Forman 1996). Second, the ‘ecosystem functions’, later redefined as ‘ecological processes’, intended as the “dynamic attributes of ecosystems, including interactions among organisms and interactions between organisms and their environments” or more simply put by Dramstad, Olson, and Forman (1996), the movements and flows of animals, plants, water, wind, materials, and energy through the structure. Lastly, a restoration project should aim to provide resiliency, the ability of the ecosystem to sustain itself without regular maintenance or interventions: the native plants and animal species should thrive, sustain reproducing populations necessary for their stability, and be capable of enduring periodic environmental stress events (such as a fire or flood) that serve to maintain the integrity of the ecosystem.\nFinally, a suggestive and far-reaching paradigm was provided by one of the founders of the movement, William Jordan, who argued that individuals and communities must be active participants in ecological recovery, and that healing natural systems would also foster the recovery of human communities. The benefits would go beyond an economic view of the use and enjoyment of our collective natural resources, encompassing the re-creation of a “sense of community” and a “sense of place.” Restoration should aim to create functioning environments where diverse species can thrive while also restoring social and historical identity in a generation increasingly disconnected from place by freeways, strip malls, and car-centric development.\n\n\n2.1.2 Problem Statement and Research Question\nAlong with the Elbe river, Dresden comprises a dense network of streams, which are spread out across its fabric. Presently, the streams are secluded from being a valuable part of the city. The problems are characterised by ecological issues, inappropriate land use by residents, and artificial channelling (Project case description). They, along with the Elbe river hold potential to become elements of integrating the ecological and social functions of the city by reclaiming the historical identity of waterfronts and restoring natural habitats. Therefore, there arises a need to understand how to integrate these streams into the network of protected green areas and public spaces, while maximising their contribution to biodiversity while adapting to the risk of flooding within and around the city.\nThese concerns and identified potentials beg the question that, how can urban streams be restored and integrated in Dresden’s fabric, such that there is a synergy between human activities and the natural environment?\nTo articulate the challenges and identify the potentials to answer the question, the analysis is divided into three sub-research categories under the broad themes of biodiversity, climate adaptation and quality of life. Each theme has specific criteria with its attributes, which are analysed, measured and weighted against each other to arrive at the final decisions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree main themes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSub-research questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Biodiversity: What are the potentials and current urgencies in the integration of the natural elements in the urban landscape of Dresden?\nThe criteria of connectivity and environmental quality are chosen to improve the existing habitats and further expand them.\n\nConnectivity — The attributes defined within connectivity aims to identify the potential of improving the connections between the existing vegetation areas. The potential green corridors along the streams are highlighted by using the ‘greenspace’ layer from OpenStreetMaps. The layer consists of the various typologies of green infrastructure of Dresden’s fabric. These are a combination of planned and recreational spaces (parks and traffic-side greenery) and natural spaces (forests, meadows, grass). To identify the potential near the streams, the following sub-criteria is defined for measurement:\n\nGreen-Blue connectivity: Blue-green infrastructure (BGI), combining semi-natural and engineered elements, offers multifaceted benefits like stormwater management, water purification, heat mitigation, and habitat provision (Perrelet et al. 2024). To analyse the gaps in vegetation along the stream corridors, the greenspace layer from OpenStreetMap is modified to see the fragments between vegetation which lie within a 250 meter buffer from the streams.\n\nEnvironmental Quality — The attributes defined under quality aim to assess the quality of the ecological environment near the streams. This is done by analysing the soil quality using the Bodenqualität (soil quality) layer from the Dresden open data portal and by analysing the plant health using the Sentinel-2 data from Google Earth Engine.\n\nSoil quality: Soil quality indicates the capacity of the soil to support ecological functions. Within the objective of integrating natural elements in the landscape of Dresden, it becomes crucial to understand where the areas with poor soil quality lie so that they can be restrored for vegetation.\nPlant health: Plant health reveals the existing plantation which is in poor quality, and is hence also impacting the health of the overall ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Climate Adaptation: What are the main challenges and the potential spatial interventions to adapt to climate change?\nTo address this question, we focused on identifying both the areas most vulnerable to climate-related hazards and those with potential for ecological intervention.\nFlood safety - Flood safety was assessed using hazard data provided by official Saxon authorities. These datasets simulate the spatial extent of flood events expected to occur once every 20 years (HQ20), 100 years (HQ100), and under an additional extreme scenario. Although often referred to as “flood risk” data, these layers are more accurately understood as hazard maps, as they depict the probability and extent of water presence without accounting for exposure or vulnerability components that would complete a full risk framework.\nThis distinction is important because it highlights both the potential and limitations of the data. While useful for planning, these layers do not incorporate social or infrastructural vulnerability, nor economic or insurance considerations. As Rözer et al. (2020) note in their analysis of Germany’s flood risk governance, despite a gradual shift toward anticipatory systems, there remains a lack of strategic focus on how to achieve resilience, and underinsurance remains widespread. Our use of this data acknowledges these limitations while offering a practical tool for relative spatial appraisal.\nSoil infiltration - The infiltration capacity of the soil was used as a proxy for local water absorption and groundwater recharge potential. The data were sourced from the Saxon State Office for Environment, Agriculture and Geology (LfULG) through their Web Feature Service and derive from a layer titled “Wasserspeichervermögen des Bodens”, or water storage capacity of soils.\nThis attribute represents the estimated ability of the soil to retain water during precipitation events, which is critical for understanding flood risk mitigation, drought resilience, and ecosystem health. While not directly a risk indicator, infiltration capacity contributes to the regulating functions of the soil and informs where permeability may reduce surface runoff and enhance local hydrological balance.\nThe classification includes five categories ranging from very low to very high infiltration capacity, allowing us to incorporate this into a relative index across urban areas.\n\n\n2.1.5 Quality of Life: How accessible, inviting, and diverse is Dresden’s public space, and how can it reach its full potential?\nUrban stream restoration is increasingly used as a strategy for improving the physical and ecological conditions of degraded urban streams. Beyond ecological benefit, it also has a social impact for enhancing the quality of life for the residents living in urban areas. Urban stream restoration can provide amenities, recreational opportunities, and environmental health benefits that contribute directly to residents’ well-being. Therefore, it is important to foster awareness and supportive attitudes toward stream restoration projects, while also addressing the issue of just distribution and equal access to streams. Below are the three key aspects of restoration projects support this benefit:\n\nAttractiveness — Aims to assess how inviting Dresden’s stream corridors are as public spaces. It involves evaluating the visibility, how the city is visible from the streams and Elbe River’s corridor. This analysis was conducted using a viewshed analysis based on example points along Dresden’s waterways, combined with a DSM file which contains elevation information and physical obstructions such as building and trees. By identifying areas with good views of the stream corridor, future interventions can make these areas more appealing and strengthen their role to provide amenities and public spaces for people in Dresden.\nPeripherality — Aims to analyse how accessible Dresden’s streams are to the public, especially within walking distance. This is done using accessibility analysis combined with population data to show how well-connected the streams are to the area where most residents live. We call it peripherality as we reversed it for our MCDA analysis (as we want higher accessibility to have lower values).\nDiversity — Aims to evaluate the diversity of land uses around the streams to support multifunctionality and encourage varied public use along the stream corridor. Areas with diverse land use (such as a combination of residential, commercial, and green spaces) tend to attract a broader range of users and encourage inclusive stream environment. In contrast, areas with single or low land-use diversity indicate less inclusive and/or underdeveloped areas that need interventions to unlock their full potential.\n\nThe two references we used for this part are Bernhardt and Palmer (2007) and Scoggins et al. (2022).\n\n\n2.1.6 Spatial Units and other notes\nThe spatial units used in this study are hexagons with a dimension of 250 meters. The study area of Dresden is divided using a complete surface of a hexagonal pattern. Then it is overlaid with the water stream network and river body from OpenStreetMap to keep only the hexagons that intersect with at least one stream. Finally, the isolated hexagons were removed.\n\n\n\nSpatial Units of waterbodies & streams across Dresden\n\n\nTo explain why the Elbe river was included in the study area is that the river is a key element that has shaped the urban growth throughout decades and many spatial and environmental features are affected by this water body. Moreover, the Elbe is spine to most of the streams across the city that branch out form it. The river itself creates a vast network of waterways all across the urban, periphery, and forest areas. Otherwise, only picking the stream network would isolate the southern bank structure from the northern bank streams in which were clustered inside the forest areas which don’t hold the potential for interventions. Therefore, the decision was made to consider the Elbe river and streams as whole water network within Dresden’s boundaries.\nThe prominent reason behind picking the dimensions of 250 meters is based on two main reasons:\n\nThe walking/biking distance: the estimated radius is used to evaluate the spaces around the water stream within a low walking distance, as pedestrians or cyclists have the highest exposure and engagement with urban streams.\nThe space but not the line: the spatial units are also going to determine the probable area of intervention. Then the streams are not the only lines that need to be changed, but the space surrounding them is also affected in both ways. This space includes the buildings, facilities, and natural habitats that all have synergies along with their neighboring stream structure.\n\n\n\n\nThe Dimensions of spatial units and the river buffer radius\n\n\nThe spatial units are also filtered by a 500-meter buffer of the main river, Elbe, as it is one of the key spatial elements that have shaped the city’s form, functions, mobilities, and identity that cannot be overlooked. So, a larger buffer of hexagonal spatial units where divided in the buffer zone of the Elbe river as it covers a larger area of the urban fabric in terms of biodiversity, morphology, climate adaptation, and quality of life.",

    "section": "2.2 Attributes and Layers",
    "text": "2.2 Attributes and Layers\n\n\n\nS-MCDA Structure\n\n\nBased on the criteria that we decided to tackle, we had to come up with numerical indicators that we could use to evaluate them. These numerical indicators are called attributes and have to be normalised—in our case between 0 and 1—so that they can be compared and weighted properly depending on their relevance. In our case, 0 corresponds to an urgent need to perform urban stream restoration, while 1 corresponds to a situation that is currently very good, or at least the best in the area of interest.\nIn practice, these attributes also needed to be aggregable at the scale of the spatial units, so that we can assign one unique value to each spatial unit for each attribute. This can be an important limitation on the type of computations and therefore the type of attributes that we can use. We explain below the different attributes that we computed, how we computed them, which data we used and why we made these choices.\n\n2.2.1 Biodiversity\n\n2.2.1.1 Green-blue connectivity\nThe aim to measure the blue-green connectivity was to identify the potential areas which can become green corridors along the lengths of the stream. To do that, the area of the vegetation layer from OpenStreetMap was quantified. The layer includes different types of green infrastructure found throughout Dresden, encompassing both designed recreational areas—such as parks and greenery along roads—and natural environments like forests, meadows, and grasslands.\n\n\n\nMapping vegetation, urbanised areas, and undeveloped areas\n\n\nThis layer was then intersected with the spatial units to focus on the vegetation which is within a 250m radius from the streams and falls within the defined spatial units. The values of the areas were then graduated to visualise the spatial units which lacked vegetation to those which were densely vegetated. These values were then normalised from 0 to 1 to make them comparable to other attributes. Here, 0 indicates the spaces which lack vegetation and 1 indicates dense vegetation, signalling at the potential spaces to add vegetation and form green corridors along the streams.\n\n\n\nIdentifying potential to establish green connectivity along the streams\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1.2 Soil quality\nSoil quality is measured as it is an integral measure of the ecological value of the soil. It is used to understand which areas near the stream have a higher concentration of poor soil quality, as soil health directly relates to the growth of biodiversity. It measured using the Bodenqualität (soil quality) layer from the Dresden open data portal. Soil quality near the streams is visualised by creating a 250 m buffer from the streams and intersecting it with the soil quality layer.\n\n\n\nMapping the soil quality of vegetation in Dresden\n\n\nThe different soil qualities, ranging from 1-6 (1 indicating low and 6 indicating extremely high quality) was intersected with the layer of the spatial units. The weighted area for each soil type in each unit was calculated by multiplying their area by their quality number. All different soil qualities present in each spatial unit were then aggregated to get the weighted area in each unit. These values were ultimately normalised and graduated to create the final map, which showed us the spatial units where there is a high concentration of poor soil quality, which are necessary to be addressed for biodiversity. Few spatial units do not have any value, aa the layer did not hold any data at those locations. Those units are dropped out from the MCDA analysis.\n\n\n\nIdentifying vegetation with good soil quality and poor soil quality along the streams\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1.3 Plant health\nPlant health is measured using the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), computed as an average of the values in June, July and August (when the vegetation is facing the highest stress) over the five last available years (2020-2024). The values are computed on a 10 by 10 m raster (based on the values of Sentinel-2), and then averaged over the spatial units. Higher values correspond to healthier vegetation.\nThe code that was used to compute the NDVI on the whole area is available in Section 1 in the appendix.\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Climate Adaptation\n\n2.2.2.1 Available space near streams\nThe necessity of available open space along the streams and the water body will be a potential opportunity for design interventions to prevent, or at least reduce, the flood risk along the streams’ banks. This can be achieved by calculating the available open space areas in the close proximity of the streams and rivers of Dresden.\n\n\n\nOpen grasslands and undeveloped lands as available spaces along the streams\n\n\nThis was assessed by using the land use ground layer collected from the [surfdrive] dataset and filtered based on the undeveloped land and grassland values. After that, the layer was intersected with the spatial units to calculate the coverage space of each land type within each spatial unit before being joined by attributes to the raw spatial units again.\n\n\n\nAvailable spaces along the streams by area\n\n\nBy joining the intersected layer to spatial units based on their join attributes, the available space within each spatial unit is already available. In order to normalize the values, the area values were all divided by the highest area number, and the new results were distributed between zero, as the lowest coverage or available area, and one, as the highest coverage and available area.\n\n\n\nNormalized values of space availability along the streams\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Flood Safety Index\nThe flood hazard data used in our analysis originate from official Saxon authorities and were developed as part of a study commissioned by the Civil Engineering Office in 2020, following new regional legislation on flood protection. A rainfall-runoff model was used to simulate three flood scenarios: events expected every 20 years (HQ20), 100 years (HQ100), and an additional extreme scenario. These simulations resulted in spatial layers indicating areas affected under each condition.\nWe created a Flood Safety Index on a scale from 0 to 1 (0 = highest exposure, 1 = safest). The process began by overlaying the three flood hazard scenarios:\n\nHQ20 (frequent flood events)\nHQ100 (centennial flood events)\nExtreme events (likely representing HQ200 or catastrophic scenarios)\n\nEach flood layer was treated as a binary indicator of hazard presence. We assigned simple weights based on perceived severity:\n\nExtreme events → 0\nHQ100 → 0.33\nHQ20 → 0.67\nAreas outside all flood zones → 1\n\nTo compute values per spatial unit, we overlaid the flood polygons with our analysis grid and calculated the area-weighted average of hazard severity values – accounting for the portion of each polygon within a unit. These averages were then normalized to a 0–1 scale.\nWhile this method does not reflect depth, speed, or return probabilities, it enables basic spatial prioritization. We acknowledge its limitations but consider it useful for exploratory and comparative planning purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.3 Soil infiltration capacity\nTo operationalize the infiltration capacity data, we accessed the Wasserspeichervermögen des Bodens WFS layer, which contains classified polygons showing estimated infiltration potential across Saxony. The classes were interpreted as follows:\n\nVery low infiltration → 0\nLow → 0.25\nMedium → 0.5\nHigh → 0.75\nVery high → 1\n\nWe intersected this dataset with our spatial units and computed the area-weighted average of the infiltration values per unit – accounting for the share of each infiltration class polygon within a spatial unit. This yielded a single score per unit, which we then normalized to a 0–1 scale for comparability.\nThe resulting Infiltration Index offers a simplified but spatially meaningful way to assess soil permeability and its contribution to local water resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2.4 Shade\nBy knowing the shade coverage of open spaces across the stream area networks, the potential areas for heat resilience can be spotted. Also, the open spaces that have the highest exposure to the heat waves can be recognized through the ground shadow analysis, especially during the peak time of warm periods in the area.\nThe DSM and DTM raster layers were needed to run the shadow analysis based on the Section 2 and vegetation heights. The raster layer was clipped out based on the dissolved layer of spatial units to limit the area of analysis. The buildings layer was also masked out from the DSM layer and patched with it again to represent the updated building heights. After that, the aspect and edge heights were calculated using the UMEP plugin to process the preliminary data for the shadow analysis. The shadow analysis is done at 15:00 within the peak time of warm period in the area which is July 15th, 2024 in Dresden.\n\n\n\nShadow analysis done by the UMEP processing tool\n\n\nThe output layer with which was a raster layer, was then aggregated to the spatial units using the Zonal Statistics tool to translate the shading values to the polygon spatial units. The output values were the counted illuminated values divided by each pixel contained within each spatial unit. After that, to define the lowest value as no shadow, the attributes were inverted by this equation:\n\\[\n\\text{Proportion\\_Shaded} = 1 - \\left(\\frac{\\text{Count\\_Illuminated}}{\\text{Count\\_Pixels}}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\nProportioning the illuminated values within the spatial units\n\n\nTo normalize the proportioned values, the attribute values were divided by the attribute with the highest value (i.e. 0.4133) since the minimum values is zero and is a meaningful one, then the normalization could be done only by dividing all values by the maximum value:\n\\[\n\\text{Normalised\\_Value} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Proportion\\_Shaded}}{0.4133}\\right)\n\\]\n\n\n\nNormalized values of shadow analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3 Quality of Life\n\n2.2.3.1 Visibility\nThe visibility factor refers to how the city is seen from the streams within a 2km radius. This analysis aims to show the potential of the streams as public spaces offering city views. When many parts of the city are visible from the stream corridors, it can show the contribute to their attractiveness. These are the steps we followed:\n\nInterpolated points from the streams’ center lines at 500 m intervals, with the assumption these points can represent the overall visibility from the streams.\nCreated viewpoints using the interpolated points as the observer location with a height of 1.6 m (eye level). In this step, we used DSM model as it considers not only elevation but also other features such as buildings and trees that might block the view.\nLimited and set the radius of the analysis to 2km, as this is considered an ideal distance. The physical aspects of objects remain visually recognizable within this range.\n\n\n\n\nVisibility Analysis was done using create viewpoints and viewshed tools\n\n\nThe output layer, in raster format (.tiff), was aggregated into spatial units using zonal statistics tool. Then, the values were normalised to a 0–1 range by dividing each value by the maximum value, where higher values indicate greater visibility from the streams.\n\n\n\nNormalized value of visibility\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3.2 Peripherality\nThe idea behind the peripherality is that for the quality of life, spatial units that are closer to places where inhabitants live are more valuable and more important than those that are harder to reach. Therefore, we wanted to study how many people leave close to each spatial unit, and are therefore accessible by feet. To do so, we settled on a threshold of 1km for the maximum distance that makes a spatial unit accessible, and we used the following steps to compute the accessibility:\n\nExtract the center point of each spatial unit. These will serve as destination points for the spatial units.\nSample points on a 200m×200m grid and only keep those in a 1km buffer around the spatial units. These will serve as start points representing where people live. Assign to each of these points a population density based on the density grid 1000m×1000m of Germany in the year 2020.\nCompute the paths between all pairs of start and destination points. We used the roads from OpenStreetMap. Using this layer required to clean up some isolated roads, because some starting points or spatial units centered would be attached to parts of the network that were not connected to the rest, and therefore it was not possible to find paths. To identify them, we run the path computation from all points to one point, and then manually removed parts of the network that were isolated and preventing the algorithm from finding paths.\nKeep only the paths that are shorter than 1km, representing convenient accessibility by feet.\nCompute the accessibility of each spatial unit \\(\\text{su}\\) as: \\[\\text{accessibility}(su) = \\sum\\limits_{sp \\;\\in\\; \\text{Starting points}} \\text{population}(sp) \\times (2000 - \\text{distance}(su,sp))\\] The reason for using 2000m as a basis is so that a 0m distance has two times more value than a 1000m distance (the maximum we kept).\nNormalise the accessibility between 0 and 1 and compute the peripherality as \\(1 - \\text{accessibility}_\\text{normalised}\\).\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility map\n\n\nThe final value is not really interpretable, as it is a population density multiplied by a distance, but it gives us a good indication of spatial units that are the most accessible.\n\n\n\nNormalized value of peripherality\n\n\n\n\n2.2.3.3 Land use variety\nThis analysis identifies the types of land use around the stream corridors. The more variety of uses enhances the connectivity of streams with the current urban fabric. When areas around the streams include a mix of public spaces, amenities, residential areas, and commercial or institutional functions, the streams become more integrated into everyday urban life. For this purpose, the land use data was simplified into 10 main categories.\n\n\n\nLand use map\n\n\nUsing this data, the diversity of land use within each spatial unit was measured, and the results were expressed through a value assigned to each unit. Then, the values were normalised within the range between 0-1 by dividing each value with the maximum value. Areas with high values indicate greater diversity in land use.\n\n\n\nNormalized value of land use",

    "text": "2.3 Weighting of the Attributes\nOnce each attribute has produced a normalised value for each spatial unit, all the attributes need to be aggregated into one final value. Since all of them do not participate equally to the goals we mentioned earlier, we tried to weight them according to their relative importance in achieving our goals. These weights could then be used to compute a weighted average that is easier to use thanks to reducing the problem to one dimension instead of several dimensions.\nTo compute the weights, we made individual Saaty matrices for the attributes of each of the three objectives. Saaty matrices are square matrices that allow us to deduce weights from pairwise comparisons of the attributes (Saaty 1987). In our case, we used the eigenvector method to calculate the weights. The matrices and weights are shown in Table 2.1 below.\nThen, we divided them by 3 to assign the same weight to the three attributes, and got a final set of weights that summed to 1. We chose this method because it allowed us to assign more weights to the most reliable and pertinent attributes, while maintaining the balance between the three main objectives.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Saaty matrix and weights for the three criteria\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Biodiversity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil quality\nPlant health\nGreen-blue connectivity\n\n\n\n\nSoil quality\n1\n3\n4\n\n\nPlant health\n1/3\n1\n2\n\n\nGreen-blue connectivity\n1/4\n1/2\n1\n\n\nWeights\n0.625\n0.238\n0.136\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Climate Adaptation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvailable space near streams\nAnticipated flood risk\nSoil infiltration capacity\nShade\n\n\n\n\nAvailable space near streams\n1\n1/2\n1/3\n2\n\n\nAnticipated flood risk\n2\n1\n3\n4\n\n\nSoil infiltration capacity\n3\n1/3\n1\n3\n\n\nShade\n1/2\n1/4\n1/3\n1\n\n\nWeights\n0.158\n0.471\n0.280\n0.090\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Quality of Life\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisibility\nPeripherality\nLand use variety\n\n\n\n\nVisibility\n1\n1/4\n1/2\n\n\nPeripherality\n4\n1\n3\n\n\nLand use variety\n2\n1/3\n1\n\n\nWeights\n0.136\n0.625\n0.238\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese weights were computed with respective consistency ratios of 0.016, 0.081, and 0.016 for Biodiversity, Climate Adaptation, and Quality of Life.

    "text": "3.4 Answers to the Questions\nRegarding the suitability of the spaces to sustain heat waves, the results are similar to what we could have expected, given that we mostly look at two attributes for this: the greenery and the shade. The forest areas are the most adapted with high greenery and shade that prevent the temperature from drastically increasing during heat waves. Transitional areas will not suffer too much from the the heat island effect thanks to a large proportion of greenery, but they also do not provide much shade to protect from the sun. The sparse urban areas are even worse because there is even less greenery and not much more shade, while the dense urban areas have at least some shade even if the heat island effect will be strong due to the soil artificialisation.\nHowever, the best areas (forests) are also the most peripherical, so the less accessible, while the most accessible (dense urban) are the worst in terms of green-blue space accessibility. It could therefore be interesting to analyse which if the dense urban areas have access in a close proximity to forest or transitional areas, that could be used during these events.\nFinally, the available space gives us information about the potential for simple interventions in each area. Transitional areas have the highest potential, meaning that they could be adapted to provide shelters in case of heat waves, for example by planting new trees. Sparse urban areas also have some potential while the dense areas already have most of their space used and forest areas should rather be kept as they are.\n\n\n\n\nBernhardt, E., and M.

Comparing the two methodology visualised results shows the outputs of the S-MCDA and Typology Construction are almost the same.\nThe overall maps illustrate the high quality of forest areas within the city that also hold a unique characteristic and encourages for further preservation and avoidance from any intervention. The zones known as Dense Urban Areas in the cluster almost have the same low value as the combined MCDA map. The orange spots that are mostly located around the Elbe river, and shapes dense urban area cluster have the lowest values and qualities based on the sub objectives of urban stream restoration criteria which makes them the areas with more problems or complexities that are needed to be tackled seriously.\nAlso, the yellow zones inside both the MCDA and typologies also have matching which makes them as the second problematic areas within the spatial units. These areas have a moderate available space for intervention and average density, but also they have a very low accessibility value. These comparisons, approve that the second problematic areas can be sparse urban areas with a nearly consent distance from the Elbe river.\nApparently, the stream network is having a high-average quality that would require the least restoration interventions at least in the non-centric districts of Dresden. Otherwise, the urban core areas need a detailed study, and after that, detailed interventions for enhancing the stream areas within the dense urban fabric that holds the most accessibility and least peripherality. The other interesting point is that the Elbe river holds more problematic characteristics compared to its streams branched out of it.",

As we discussed our individual motivations on the first day, we realised we all shared the passion to understand the use of urban application data in real-life scenarios. We further divided the roles which we voluntarily picked, realising that they may overlap during the process, we could each take an overarching responsibility for specific processes. We divided them as follows:\nAlankrita Sharma (Urbanism) - Research Lead, Presentation Lead Alexandre Bry (Geomatics): Project Coordinator, Data Analyst Adriano Mancini (Urbanism): Design Lead Grase Stephanie (Urbanism): Mapping Specialist Soroush Saffarzadeh (Urbanism): Writer/Editor, Presentation Lead\nThe roles helped us to have a broader clarity for our responsibilities, and that helped us to track specific progress within each task. As the majority of us were from urbanism, we noted how we were more active in understanding the urban context and spatial logic to derive the attributes, while our teammate from geomatics complemented the course by breaking down each attribute to tangible calculations that could be computed. This made us revise and reconsider our choices until we finally arrived at a group of measurable attributes that were also relevant for the context. The role of the geomatics discipline was specifically relevant when the computation was complex, such as in understanding how to aggregate the data to each spatial unit and computing the average values for the S-MCDA. Here, as time allowed us as well, we were able to learn from each other and grasp an understanding of computing the weighted average. For typology construction, however, the role for data analytics was more limited to the geomatics teammate, although we all coordinated in devising the research question, finalising attributes for the clusters, and drawing inferences from results. Though this helped the urbanism groupmates to theoretically understand the value of typology construction, the practical understanding of the method was limited. While we experienced certain challenges at times due to our schedules for different courses, we were able to shift and add responsibilities in those instances. Overall, our workflow could also be described as an effective interdisciplinary project, where we were able to bring our different skills and perspectives together to apply urban data to a specific case of urban stream restoration.\n\n\n\n\nBernhardt, E., and M.

    "text": "This report was focused on applying spatial analysis utilizing the S-MCDA & Typology Construction as quantitative research methods to evaluate the urban streams within the city of Dresden based on the urban stream restoration goal. The process was started by initial studies of Dresden and its natural elements creating the man-made and ecological synergies within the built and landscape environments. After that, the sub objectives of the goal were defined concentrating on three main themes:\n\nBiodiversity\nClimate Adaptation\nQuality of Life\n\nThe attributes were defined to be measured within the context. The MCDA and Typology methods were used to measure the specific attributes of each theme and at last, the results were compared and represented as the zones for intervention potentialities or prevention. The MCDA method was used to create a weighted evaluation based on priorities of each attribute over the other in each theme. Finally, the summed weighted values of three main themes were combined together in a spatial unit with average value of all MCDA maps into one synthesized map that illustrated the areas of complexities and low quality of ecological values mostly concentrated in the southern bank of Elbe river. The Typology Construction method was implemented by defining three main variables to represent each stream restoration theme. The variables were normalized between 0 and 1 and classified in four clusters by its k-mean values. The general clusters were visualized in different zones. The low-quality clusters based on defined variables were mostly concentrated in southern bank of Elbe as well. At the end, the results of the two spatial analysis methods were compared. The final discussion was made to result in intervention suggestions along with areas to prevent from or run more research and detailed analysis to achieve a deeper understanding of the urban streams and their surrounding areas.\n\n\n\n\nBernhardt, E., and M.

It actually computes the NDVI as well as two other indices (NDREI and NDWI) that we ended up not using for our analysis. You can easily compute other indices with the library that is used, by changing the variable called indices. Furthermore, it computes an average on the last five years, roughly for each season, and exports the data to Google Earth Engine. You might have to change the output path to adapt it to your situation in the call to the function Export.image.toDrive.

    "section": "Building Geometry",
    "text": "Building Geometry\nThe process of fixing the geometries of the clipped building layer can be done through this text Since the building layer had several geometry errors, it went through some geometry validation and fixing processes (i.e. valid geometry, fix geometries, simplify and re-project). For a smoother experience, you can read through this process to fix your geometries:\n“Use “Check Validity” Go to: Vector → Geometry Tools → Check Validity\nChoose “GEOS” as the engine.\nReview the reported issues — “valid” in QGIS may not be sufficient for overlay ops if robustness is compromised.\nFix Geometries (Again) Run: Vector → Geometry Tools → Fix Geometries\nIf already done, try exporting the layer as a new file (Right-click layer → Export → Save Features As…) to reset underlying geometry representations.\nSimplify or Snap Geometries Minor overlaps/gaps or very close vertices can trigger GEOS precision issues.\nTry:\nVector → Geometry Tools → Snap geometries to layer\nor Vector → Geometry Tools → Simplify Geometry\nUse “Invalid Geometry Handling” in Processing If using model/processing tools, go to the settings (Processing → Options) → “Invalid geometry handling” → set to “Ignore features with invalid geometries” (temporary workaround).\nUse Buffer(0) as a Cleanup Trick Use the expression:\nbuffer($geometry, 0)\nin the Geometry by Expression tool. It often resolves subtle robustness problems.\nYour raster is in EPSG:25833, but you’re trying to extract it using a mask layer in EPSG:32633. These CRS look similar (both UTM zone 33N), but they’re not the same datum:\nEPSG:25833 → ETRS89 (used in Europe, based on stable tectonic plate)\nEPSG:32633 → WGS84 (global standard)\nGEOS and GDAL can throw robustness errors if vector and raster CRS differ even slightly during masking.\nOption 1: Reproject the Mask Layer to Match the Raster Right-click the mask layer → Export → Save Features As…\nSet CRS to EPSG:25833\nUse the new projected mask layer for extraction.\nThen:\nRaster → Extraction → Clip Raster by Mask Layer\nUse this EPSG:25833 version of the mask\nOption 2: Reproject the Raster Instead If the mask needs to stay in 32633, reproject the raster:\nRaster → Projections → Warp (Reproject)\nTarget CRS: EPSG:32633\nResampling: Nearest neighbour (for categorical) or Bilinear (for continuous)\nSave as new GeoTIFF\nThen run the extract using the reprojected raster.\nAlways ensure both raster and mask have the exact same CRS (code and datum), not just similar projection zones. Otherwise, operations like masking can fail due to subtle misalignments or geometry issues.\nFurthermore, if you received such error:\nWarning 1: Holes are nested at or near point 403128.48007987819 5659925.564998446ERROR 1: Cutline polygon is invalid.\nThis means your cutline (mask) layer dissolved_fixed_reprojected.shp has self-intersecting or nested holes.\nGDAL (gdalwarp) cannot use this geometry until it is fully valid and simplified.\nFinal Fix — Repair Deep Geometry Issues Do the following in exact order:\nExplode MultiParts Vector → Geometry Tools → Multipart to Singleparts → Run it on dissolved_fixed_reprojected.shp → Save result as e.g. dissolved_singleparts.shp\nUse “Buffer(0)” Trick Open Processing Toolbox\nUse Geometry by Expression on the singlepart layer\nExpression:\nbuffer($geometry, 0)\nSave as: dissolved_cleaned_buffer0.shp\nThis rewrites the geometry and usually removes nested holes and invalid rings.\nFinal Geometry Check Run Check Validity tool on dissolved_cleaned_buffer0.shp\nGEOS engine\nAll features must be valid\nReproject This Layer (if needed) If your raster is in EPSG:25833, make sure this cleaned mask is also in EPSG:25833.\nIf you found a few invalid geometries after running Check Validity, do this:\nFix Them Properly (Step-by-Step) 1. Isolate Invalid Features Open the Check Validity output layer (or attribute table):\nFilter by “valid” = ‘0’\nSelect all invalid features\nFix Individually or in Batch Use either:\nA. Manual Fix:\nEnable editing\nUse vertex tool to correct overlapping rings, holes, etc.\nUseful for &lt;10 features\nB. Automated Fix:\nSelect invalid features\nRun: Vector → Geometry Tools → Fix Geometries\nOnly apply to selected features\nSave as fixed_invalids.shp\nReplace Invalids in Main Layer Use “Merge Vector Layers”:\nInput: your original cleaned valid layer + fixed_invalids.shp\nOutput: final_cleaned_mask.shp\nif you faced such error:\nWarning 1: Too few points in geometry component at or near point 7143.291…ERROR 1: Cutline polygon is invalid.\nmeans you have “degenerate geometries” in your “valid” features — like a polygon made from just 1 or 2 vertices, which isn’t a valid polygon for GDAL.\nSolution: Remove Features with Too Few Vertices Open the attribute table of valid_only_mask_readyformask.shp\nUse this filter in the expression dialog:\nnum_points($geometry) &gt;= 4\nExport the selected features:\nRight-click → Export → Save Selected Features As…\nName it valid_clean_mask.shp\nOptional: Run Buffer(0) Again Just to be sure:\nGeometry by Expression\nUse: buffer($geometry, 0)\nSave result as final_cutline_mask.shp\nRetry Clipping Now use final_cutline_mask.shp as your cutline. This should fully eliminate:\nNested holes\nInvalid rings\nToo-few-points geometries\nLet me know if you’d prefer a PyQGIS script or model to automate this.\nIf you faced this error:\nWarning 1: Self-intersection at or near point … ERROR 1: Cutline polygon is invalid.\nmeans even after filtering and buffering, some geometries still have self-intersections, often caused by very small rings or overlapping vertices introduced during buffering or fixing.\nFinal Clean Repair: Force Rebuild of Valid Topology Do this:\nUse Delete Holes Vector → Geometry Tools → Delete holes\nInput: final_cutline_mask_buffered.shp\nKeep minimum area very small (e.g. 0.0001)\nSave as final_noholes.shp\nSimplify + Buffer(0) Combo Now:\nRun Simplify Geometry:\nTolerance: 0.01 to 0.1 depending on your unit (meters)\nSave as final_simplified.shp\nThen apply buffer($geometry, 0) again on that layer\nRe-check Validity One Last Time Use Check Validity (GEOS) on the result.\nEnsure all features pass.\nUse That as Cutline Use the output from the above steps (final_simplified_buffered.shp) as your mask layer.”\nRecap & Summary\nAlways match CRS between raster and mask.\nRun Check Validity, Delete Holes, Simplify, and buffer($geometry, 0) on complex masks.\nFilter out degenerate geometries (num_points($geometry) &lt; 4).\nUse batch or models to automate cleanup when needed.\nResample the raster to smaller resolution\nAfter processing the mask layer, it was used to clip the raster layer and patched with the DSM layer to go through the shadow analysis process. Since the raster layer is very large, there’s a need to reduce the resolution or just clipping it to a smaller area, unless a strong machine with minimum 32GB RAM would run the analysis. Otherwise, the process cannot be done due to lack of memory in your machine.\n“To resample the raster resolution:\nIf you’re using 0.5m or 1m resolution:\nUse Raster → Projections → Warp (Reproject)\nSet a coarser pixel size (e.g. 2m or 5m)\nResampling: Average or Nearest Neighbour”.\nThe patched layer was resampled to 3m resolution which made the process feasible.",
